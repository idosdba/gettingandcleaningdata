### Source:
The original data set is obtained from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

**Excerpt from the source:**
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person 
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial 
linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded 
to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers 
was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

**For each record it is provided:**

1. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
1. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
1. A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
1. Its activity label.
1. An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
